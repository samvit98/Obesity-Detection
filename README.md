# Obesity Risk Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing obesity levels across Mexico, Peru, and Colombia using predictive modeling techniques. The goal is to identify individuals at high risk of obesity and provide insights for targeted interventions and healthcare strategies.

## Business Goal
The primary objective of this project is to identify individuals at high risk of obesity in the selected countries using predictive modeling. The insights gained from this analysis will inform targeted interventions and healthcare strategies to address obesity-related challenges.

## Solution
### Approach
- Utilized Linear Regression, Ordinal Logistic Regression, and CART models to analyze the impact of dietary habits, physical activity, lifestyle choices, and demographic characteristics on obesity levels.
- Removed direct correlations with target variables and performed model evaluation using test sets.
- Employed GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning and validation to ensure model accuracy and generalizability.

### Technologies Used
- Python for data analysis, modeling, and visualization.
- Libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib for data manipulation, modeling, and visualization.
- Utilized Jupyter Notebooks for interactive data exploration and model development.
- Tableau for data analysis

## Data Visualization


## Outcome
### Business Outcome
The CART model emerged as the most successful, indicating its suitability for obesity level classification. The study underscores the importance of understanding obesity factors for effective healthcare and policy strategies.

### Technical Outcome
- Linear Regression achieved 37% accuracy.
- Ordinal Logistic Regression improved to 47% accuracy.
- CART model showed the highest accuracy at 78%, especially in higher obesity categories.

## Future Steps
- Explore additional features and data sources to enhance model accuracy and predictive power.
- Implement ensemble modeling techniques for further improvement in obesity risk prediction.
- Collaborate with healthcare professionals and policymakers to implement targeted interventions based on model insights.
